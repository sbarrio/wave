 # Wave
And endless (?) running game where you play as a Frog running away from a tidal wave. 

Built with <a href="https://haxeflixel.com/">HaxeFlixel</a> and <a href="https://sbarrio.github.io/devlog.html#wave">released for iOS and Android back in 2016</a>.

The game has been delisted from both platforms now, so here's it's source code openly available for posterity.
